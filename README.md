# Bank-App

JavaScript arrays are a fundamental data structure used in many different applications. While working with these arrays, you can benefit from many methods such as push(), unshift(), pop(), shift(), splice(), reverse(), sort(), fill(), map(), filter(), slice(), concat(), flat(), flatMap(), indexOf(), findIndex(), find(), includes(), some(), every(), join(), reduce(), and forEach().

These methods make it easy to perform many operations such as adding, removing, editing, sorting, filtering, or reshaping elements in an array. Thanks to these features, it is possible to increase efficiency and speed up the coding process while working with arrays.

With the help of my instructor, I developed the Mini Bank application inspired by these examples. This provided me with the opportunity to learn these methods in practice and gain the ability to manage my projects more effectively.
